🏢 MONOLITHIC ARCHITECTURE
🧠 Simple Idea:
👉 Everything is one big application.

All features (login, payment, orders, users, etc.) run together on:

🖥 One server

🗄 One database

🧱 Structure
One App
 ├── Login
 ├── Orders
 ├── Payments
 ├── Products
 └── Admin
        ↓
   Single Database

🎯 Real-Life Example
Think of a small restaurant:

👨‍🍳 One kitchen
👨‍🍳 Same chef cooks everything
🍽 Same counter serves all dishes

If the kitchen stops → whole restaurant stops.

✅ Advantages
Good Thing	Why
Easy to build	Simple structure
Easy to deploy	One code, one server
Good for small apps	Less complexity
❌ Problems
Problem	Why
Hard to scale	Need to scale entire app, not one part
One bug = whole app down	Everything is connected
Slow development	Big codebase, hard for many teams
Technology locked	Must use same language/framework
🚨 Example Problem
Payment module has issue → whole app redeployed → login, orders also affected.
