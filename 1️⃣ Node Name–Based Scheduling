1️⃣ Node Name–Based Scheduling
What it means

We manually tell Kubernetes to run a Pod on one specific worker node by using the node name in the deployment file.

Example idea:

“Run this pod only on worker-node-1.”

Kubernetes will not choose another node.

How it is done (concept)

We use nodeName in the Pod spec.

spec:
  nodeName: worker-node-1


This forces the pod to run only on that node.

Limitations (Very Important)
❌ 1. Only one node can be mentioned

You can specify only ONE worker node

You cannot give multiple node options

❌ 2. No rescheduling if node goes down

If that worker node fails or goes down

Pod will NOT move to another node

Pod goes into Pending state

Why this is BAD for production

No High Availability

Single point of failure

Manual and inflexible

Real-Life Example

“I will sit only on seat number 5.
If seat 5 is broken, I will stand and wait.”

Better Alternative (Recommended)

Use:

Node Affinity

Pod Anti-Affinity

These allow Kubernetes to choose another node automatically.

One-Line Interview Answer

Node name–based scheduling forces a pod to run on a specific node, but if that node fails, the pod stays pending and does not reschedule.
